# Box Example — xel:object Module Demonstration

This example demonstrates the core features of the `xel:object` module.

You’ll see how to:

- Create and manipulate objects as flexible containers (boxes)
- Access and modify properties dynamically
- Nest objects and handle deep structures
- Use built-in utilities provided by `xel:object`

Run this example with:

```bash
xel run example/box/main.xel
```
